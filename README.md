# Learning-React
Follow my journey as I learn one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks ReactJS
I will be following Jonas Shmedtmann's Udemy course on React and each day I will be updating my progress with daily updates.
Each folder of each day will consist of a ReadMe file which will describe what I have learnt for the day so it will be easier to follow.
Join me as I venture on this path of React.
